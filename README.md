1. Install Flask:
If you haven't already then no need, otherwise install Flask using the following command:
```
pip install Flask
```
2. for Access the Web App:
Open your web browser and go to
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
to access the plant hybridization web app.

This example uses Flask for the web framework and integrates the plant hybridization code with a basic HTML form. When you fill out the form with parent traits and submit it, the hybridization process takes place, and the results are displayed on the same page. Remember that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you'd want to handle form validation, improve the user interface, and possibly use more sophisticated genetic models for hybridizationâœ¨
